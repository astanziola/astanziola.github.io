I am currently a Research Fellow in Teorectical and Computational Acoustics at the üêõ [Biomedical Ultrasound Group](https://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk) of UCL. I am also member of the [Maths4DL programme](https://maths4dl.ac.uk/team-member/antonio-stanziola).

Previously, I was briefly a consultant at [TTP](https://www.ttp.com/) in the Health Tech division, after being a Research Fellow at the [Biomedical Ultrasound Group](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk), working on Deep Learning for Transcranial Ultrasound Neurostimulation. I have a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, from [Imperial College](https://tanglab.bg.ic.ac.uk/) with a specialization in [ultrasound vascular imaging and beamforming with contrast agents](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/78639).

My experience is in various areas more or less related to [ultrasound](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7426573) and deep learning, such as acoustics, [ultrasound imaging and beamforming](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29994061/), signal processing, [numerical methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04948.pdf). I also have background in [differentiable programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05218), [PDE modeling](https://github.com/ucl-bug/jwave), [deep learning for scientific computing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999121003259), medical imaging and inverse problems, [computer vision, and image analysis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7164062).


I also like dogs and my parent's golden retriever [Spritz](https://www.instagram.com/ahperospritz/).
