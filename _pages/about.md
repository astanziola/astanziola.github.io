I'm a Research Fellow at the [Biomedical Ultrasound Group](http://bug.medphys.ucl.ac.uk), working on Deep Learning for Transcranial Ultrasound Neurostimulation. Where, among various things, I'm trying to [accelerate acoustic simulations using deep learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999121003259).

Lately, I became very interested in differentiable programming and I've been working on a couple of JAX projects, namely: [`jwave`](https://github.com/ucl-bug/jwave), a fully differentiable ultrasound simulator inspired by the pseudospectral solver [k-Wave](http://www.k-wave.org/), and a framework for writing differentiable simulators with arbitrary discretizations called [`jaxdf`](https://github.com/ucl-bug/jaxdf).

I'm also interested in ultrasound image and signal processing, especially beamforming, scientiﬁc machine learning, medical image analysis, inverse problems and uncertantiy quantiﬁcation.

I also like dogs and my parent's golden retriever [Spritz](https://www.instagram.com/ahperospritz/).
