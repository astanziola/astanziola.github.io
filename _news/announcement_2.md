Our latest two papers have been published on Arxiv. The first one proposed a [Learned Born Series](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04948.pdf) for fast simulation on high-scattering media, and the second one proposes and auto-diff based method for [uncertainty quantification in transcranial ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.04405.pdf).
