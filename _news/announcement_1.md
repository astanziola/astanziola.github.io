I received the ASA Computational Acoustics Early Career Presenter Award at the [186th ASA Meeting](https://acousticalsociety.org/ottawa/) for my presentation on the [Application of differentiable programming to wave simulation](https://pubs.aip.org/asa/jasa/article/155/3_Supplement/A106/3301139/Application-of-differentiable-programming-to-wave)!
